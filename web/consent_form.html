<h3>Project: Human-Computer Question Answering</h3>

<h4>Purpose of the Study</h4>
<p style="text-align:left">
This research is being conducted by Jordan Boyd-Graber at the University of
Maryland. The purpose of this research project is better understand how
individuals process incremental information under constraints and how computers
can improve quiz bowl players' question answering ability.
</p>

<h4>Procedures</h4>
<p style="text-align:left">
The procedures involve answering trivia questions in a competitive environment:
you can compare how quickly you answer questions compared to other players on
the site through a leaderboard. You will be shown trivia questions; answer them
as soon as you know the answer.
</p>
 
<p style="text-align:left">
You will be shown guesses from a computerized system. You are free to use these
hints to answer questions more quickly. Not all users will be shown the same
visualizations or the same guesses. This helps us determine which systems and
which methods of displaying the guesses are most helpful.
</p>
 
<h4>Potential Risks and Discomforts</h4>
<p style="text-align:left">
There are no known risks beyond that of using a computer.
</p>
 
<h4>Potential Benefits</h4>
<p style="text-align:left">
The benefits to you include the ability to competitively practice trivia online.
We hope that this study will also enhance our understanding of the incremental
processing of information. You will also be entered in a raffle to win a gift
card.
